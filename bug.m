In Objective-C, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with memory management using ARC (Automatic Reference Counting).  Specifically, it involves strong reference cycles within blocks. Consider this scenario:

```objectivec
@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (strong, nonatomic) NSString *myString;
@end

@implementation MyClass
- (void)someMethod {
    __weak MyClass *weakSelf = self; // Create a weak reference to avoid strong cycle
    dispatch_async(dispatch_get_global_queue(DISPATCH_QUEUE_PRIORITY_DEFAULT, 0), ^{ 
        // Error: Potential strong reference cycle
        weakSelf.myString = [NSString stringWithFormat:@"Hello from background thread"]; 
    });
}
@end
```

This code snippet seems harmless, but it creates a strong reference cycle. Even with `weakSelf`, the assignment `weakSelf.myString = ...` implicitly retains `self` through the `myString` property (because `myString` is `strong`). Therefore, the inner block retains `self`, and `self` retains the block (implicitly), leading to a memory leak.

Another example involves delegates:
```objectivec
@interface MyDelegate : NSObject <MyProtocol>
@property (nonatomic, weak) MyViewController *viewController;

- (void)myProtocolMethod;
@end

@interface MyViewController : UIViewController <MyProtocol>
@property (nonatomic, strong) MyDelegate *delegate;

@end
```
If `MyViewController` is the delegate of a `MyDelegate` object and `MyDelegate` has a strong reference to `MyViewController`, and `MyViewController` has a strong reference to `MyDelegate`, then you have a retain cycle.
